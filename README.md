# OpenGL ES Android App
It is a basic Android app which uses OpenGL ES API. I defined a triangle and created three triangles with different color and positions and I drew these triangles and rotated them. I applied projection and camera views so id you change the roation of the phone, the triangles don't skewed. Also if you swipe your finger on the screen, the triangles rotate where you swope.

You can run this project on your device by installing the [app-debug.apk](https://github.com/burhanelgun/OpenGL-ES-Android-Application/raw/master/app-debug.apk).
